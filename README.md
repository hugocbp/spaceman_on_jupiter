# Spaceman on Jupiter - A JavaScript game

Spaceman on Jupiter is a simple game developed from scratch with HTML5 and
vanilla JavaScript as a final project for the CPSC 1045 Introduction to Web
Programming class in Langara College.

The requirements were:

- Use only vanilla JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas, with no external libraries or
  frameworks
- Have some interactivity to reach a goal (as in... the game should be playable)

Some small improvements were made after final submission.
